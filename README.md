# Cash Register Simulator

A lightweight JavaScript cash register object that lets you:

- Define items for sale  
- Add items to a shopping cart  
- Calculate totals (with automatic 10% discount for orders over $500)  
- Process payments and display change or error messages  

All logic runs in plain ES6 JavaScript‚Äîno frameworks or build steps required.
